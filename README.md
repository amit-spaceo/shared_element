# shared_element

Ever since the launch of Android apps, developers always experiment with different UI widgets to develop user-friendly Android apps. With the release of Android Lollipop, cool new design features have also been introduced including reveal animation, Shared element, transitions activity, and so on.

Though, it’s fairly easy to implement it in Android Lollipop, but implementing shared element transitions activity in older version might become a daunting task.

In our today’s Android app tutorial, we’ll build Android app to demonstrate the [shared element implementation process](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/implement-shared-element-android-transitions-activity/).

Shared element transitions activity can be easy to implement with the above process, but don’t try to be brave and implement all transitions manually by yourself, unless you’re a pro Android App developer. And, in case you insist on implementing it, [hire Android app development company](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/android-app-development/) to help you with Shared element implementation for your Android app development project.
